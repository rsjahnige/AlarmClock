# Arduino Alarm Clock
As a whole, the code contained within this repository offers an Alarm Clock implementation for an Arduino microcontroller, complete with a user interface that
displays text on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) linked to a Joy Stick module. The code has been written with the intention that much of it can be reused for other
Arduino projects; if desired, please refer to the [Implementation Notes](#implementation-notes) and [Disclaimers](#disclaimers) sections of this document before proceeding. 
## Hardware Set-up
A schematic diagram is provided within this repository, as a '.bch' file that was generated using PCB Creator, which can be used to replicate the circuit for this project. 
## User Interface
The user interface for this project consists of two main components: (1) LCD and (2) Joy Stick module; as well as three auxiliary components: (1) Alarm Button, (2) LCD Switch, and (3) LCD Potentiometer.
A further description of each component is provided below:
1. LCD
2. Joy Stick Module
3. Alarm Button
4. LCD Switch
5. LCD Potentiometer
## Implementation Notes
## Disclaimers
1. **This code is _NOT_ well tested -** a majoriy of testing was performed by simply playing with the user interface.
